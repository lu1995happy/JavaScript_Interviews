## AJAX

AJAX \(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\) is to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send data and retrieve from a server asynchronously in the background without the need to reload the entire page. 

The `XMLHttpReques`t API is frequently used for the asynchronous communication or these days, the `fetch` API. 

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of using AJAX

Advantages:

* Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. 
* Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once. 
* State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.
* Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.

Disadvantages:

* Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.
* Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.
* Some web-crawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript. 
* Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA.
