# JSX

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to `React.createElement()` calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”.

## Why JSX

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display. Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called "components" that contain both. 

## Understanding JSX

```javascript
// JSX
return (
    <div className="App"> 
        <h1>React</h1>
    </div>
);

// JavaScript
return React.createElement("div", {className: "App"}, 
    React.createElement("h1", null, "React"));
```
