# Concepts

## HTML

HyperText Markup Language \(HTML\) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

## DOM

when a web page is loaded, the browser creates a document object model of the page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects.

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets \(CSS\) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Redux

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. The basic idea of redux is that the entire application state is kept in a single store. The store is simply a JavaScript object. The only way to change the state is by firing actions from your application and then writing reducers for these actions that modify the state. The entire state transition is kept inside reducers and should not have any side-effects. 

## Thunk

Thunk is a subroutine used to inject an additional calculation into another subroutine. Thunks are primarily used to delay a calculation until its result is needed, or to insert operations at the beginning or end of the other subroutine. Thunk is used for async operations. 

## Node.JS

Node.JS is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.

## Express

Express.JS is a web application framework for Node.JS. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

## REST

Representational State Transfer \(REST\) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a set of stateless operations, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

## RESTful

RESTful is based on representational state transfer \(REST\) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development. 

## Closure

Closure is an inner function that has access to the outer \(enclosing\) function's variables-scope chain. Closure is a stack frame which is allocated when a function starts its execution, and not freed after the function returns. 

## Single Page Application

Single-Page application \(SPA\) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

## Promise

The Promise object represents the eventual completion \(or failure\) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. It is in one of these three states: pending, fulfilled and rejected. 

## TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React "elements". You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.  

## AJAX

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is about loading data in the background and display it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.

## Media Query and usage 

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. In order to implement Responsive Design to adapt different screen. 

## Pseudo Class and usage 

The Pseudo Class is used to define a special state of an element. 

For instance, it can be used to: 

* style an element when a user mouses over it "div: hover"
* style visited and unvisited links differently "a: link", "a: visited"
* style an element when it get focus

## PX, EM, REM

Pixels \(px\) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel \(dot\) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels. 1px = 1/96th of 1in.

EM relative to the font-size off the element \(2em means that 2 times the size of the current font\).

REM relative the font-size.

## Prototype

Every object has a property called "prototype". It's also an object. 

## Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope. 

## Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler

## Accessibility

* subtitle
* color
* light conditions
* voice searching
* text for speech
* clear layout navigation
* notification and feedback
* error message \(learning disability\)
* large button and click control for mobile
* customized text size color space \(vision disability\)
* understandable context
* keyboard compatibility \(mouse broken\)
